# 03_working_notebooks 

Use this folder to create working notebooks in the form of TeX documents, Rmd or ipynb files. These are your equivalent to the notebooks a physicist, chemist or biologist would keep while working on practical experiments. 

Record both what works and what does not work, the decisions you make along the way and why you chose the options that you did. This will provide a base for the thesis and help to structure discussions during supervisor meetings.
