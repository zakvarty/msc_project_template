# msc_project_template 

## Directory Structure 

- `.gitignore` add file names and types here that you do not want to version control.
- `LICENCE` licence for project work, by default MIT.
- `01_meeting_notes/` A place to keep a record of meeting discussions. 
- `02_reading` A place to keep and share relevant readings, papers and your notes on them.
- `03_working_notebooks` A place to keep rough write-ups as you go. It is _highly_ recommended that you write up all of your work as you go rather than waiting until the end of the project to begin writing. This creates a first, rough draft of thesis content and allows you to show your work during meetings. 
- `04_code/` A place to keep all data, source files and output for code relating to the project. 
- `05_thesis` A place to keep your LaTeX write-up under version control (or to link to an external service such as Overleaf)
