# 02 - reading/

Use this section to keep track of what you are reading and what you learn from each article or book chapter. 

I recommend that you make detailed notes separately for each reading but keep a central summary of all readings and thier meta-information including the corresponding BibTeX reference you use. This allows you to quickly remind yourself of key ideas and to find which paper you are trying to reference without reading them all over again.

An example of how you might want to do this is given below. Feel free to use your own method here instead.

`varty2021inference`

**Title:** _Inference for extreme earthquake magnitudes accounting for a time-varying measurement process. {ArXiV preprint, 2021} (20 pages)._

**Authors:** _Zak Varty, Jonathan Tawn, Peter Atkinson and Stijn Bierman._

**Key words:** _extreme value_, _earthquake_, _threshold selection_, _magnitude of completion_, _seismology_, _bootstrap._

In this paper, Varty et al (2021) propose a new threshold selection method for modelling earthquake catalogues where the magnitude distribution is stationary but detection of small events improves over time. The paper generalises the Gutenberg-Richter law to the GPD and uses metrics based on PP and QQ plots to balance between bias and variance when selecting a time-varying threshold. This procedure more than doubles the usable catalogue size for Groningen earthquakes and gives the first emprircal evidence that the magnitude distribution in this region has a finite upper end point. The paper is targeted at applied and research statisticians with an interest in EVT but would be accessible to a statistically-minded seismologist.
